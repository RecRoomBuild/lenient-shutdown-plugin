By checking this option, all entries in the queue and all downstream builds they trigger are allowed to finish. 
If this option is unchecked, only those entries from the queue are allowed that are a downstream build when lenient shutdown is activated.
Entries that are triggered by any other cause will not start unless they are in the allow-list and the corresponding option is enabled.
