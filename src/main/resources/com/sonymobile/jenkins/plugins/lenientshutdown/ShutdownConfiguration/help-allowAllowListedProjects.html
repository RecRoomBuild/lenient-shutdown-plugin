Allow allow-listed projects to run when global lenient shutdown is enabled and while any permitted builds are still running.
Once all builds that have been running when lenient shutdown was activated and their downstream builds are finished, 
no more allow-listed projects will start that are not triggered by an upstream build.
<p>
It is not recommended to allow-list projects that have a long runtime or trigger many downstream projects.
